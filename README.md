# Intron-Predictor
Project from BME160
This program was inspired by Michael R Brent's 2007 article in Nature titled "How does eukaryotic gene prediction work?" In his article, Brent presented a weight diagram of nucleotide frequency at splice sites, which served as the foundation for this project.[1] The weight diagram gave me the idea to attempt to make an intron predictor that looks for the start and end of an intron sequence. My interest in identifying splice sites comes from my involvement in the Toxic RNA Lab, led by Jeremy Sandford, where we study mutations that may affect splicing.

To make a program capable of predicting something as complex as splicing, compromises and simplifications had to be considered. The biggest was to only look at 12 nucleotides per predicted intron. 

The project began by converting the weight diagram into a probability chart. For instance; at a position away from the splice site, if all four nucleotides had equal presence, the probabilities would be distributed as follows: G:0.25, A:0.25, T:0.25, C:0.25. With the probability chart in hand, I set out to identify my ‘starts’ and ‘stops’.

The first two and last two nucleotides are highly conserved at almost every intron-exon boundary. This led to creating a 'starts' set to locate the first two nucleotides of an intron, all starting with 'GT'. Similarly, an 'ends' set was generated by searching the sequence for 'AG' the two conserved nucleotides at the end of an intron. Using the generated 'starts' and 'ends', likelihood values were computed by multiplying the probabilities of all nucleotides in each set. Stops and starts with a likelihood of 0 were removed.

The next step involved generating introns by matching a start to an end. All possible combinations were generated, resulting in various starts matched to the same stop location. The results were visualized using MATLAB, employing a color scale to indicate likelihood values.

Before beginning this project, I hypothesized that the highest likelihood generated would correspond to the actual intron and match the reference. However, I discovered that likelihood plays a minor role in determining the actual intron used. Splicing involves more than just the twelve nucleotides I initially considered. One significant factor is the presence of splicing regulatory elements, such as enhancers and silencers, within the pre-mRNA sequence. These elements interact with splicing factors, including spliceosomal and RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation[2], can affect alternative splicing by altering chromatin structure and accessibility to splicing machinery. The program doesn't consider these factors but a more robust program could. 

The program is also limited by the capabilities of the device it is running on. In a test of a 5,000 bp size sequence, it took the program over an hour to complete and the resulting visual results were hard to interpret because there was so much data the graph became unreadable. A better PC or a PC cluster such as UCSC Hummingbird could help with that issue, and the graph would need to be meaningfully scaled to handle a larger volume of predicted introns. 

A setting implemented into the program is the option to sort by a desired length to find introns close to that length. While the program successfully identifies the correct intron it is contained within the set of generated introns. Without knowing the expected length, identifying it would be like finding a needle in a haystack. 
In conclusion, this project aims to contribute to computational genomics by providing a tool for predicting and visualizing potential introns within genomic sequences. This program utilizes a probability-based approach to identify key sequence motifs indicative of splice sites. While the program successfully predicts intron-exon boundaries, it also highlights the challenges inherent in predicting splicing events solely based on a limited nucleotide sequence. The program will find the intron but it will find so many potential introns that it is difficult to get meaningful data without already knowing the intron of interest’s length.  Future advancements could involve integrating additional sequence features, regulatory elements, and optimizing computational efficiency to handle larger genomic datasets.
